Supported configuration:

Visual Studio 2012, Win64
=========================

In order to build the RTF example applications, you will first need to
obtain and build a few support libraries.  In the following, we will
assume that all of these libraries will be built in the directory
c:\rtf-supp\.

1) Obtain a pre-built binary of cmake from http://www.cmake.org/, and
ensure the cmake.exe binary is in your PATH system variable.

2) If you want to leverage support for MPI in order to train models on
a Microsoft HPC cluster, download and install the HPC Pack 2012, and HPC Pack
2012 MS-MPI Redistributable Package, available at
http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=39959
and
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36045

3) Obtain and build the boost libraries from http://www.boost.org.

Build the boost libraries as follows:

   a) Download and unpack the boost distribution to c:\rtf-supp\.

   b) Open a Visual Studio 2012 x64 command prompt and cd to the boost
      directory, e.g. c:\rtf-supp\boost_1_54_0\.

   c) Run bootstrap.bat.

   d) If you want support for MPI, edit
      c:\rtf-supp\boost_1_54_0\project-config.jam and add a line:
      'using mpi ;'.

   e) If you want support for MPI, edit
      c:\rtf-supp\boost_1_54_0\tools\build\v2\tools\mpi.jam and:
        
        Replace:
          local cluster_pack_path_native = 
            "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Compute Cluster Pack" ;
        By:
          local cluster_pack_path_native = 
            "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft HPC Pack 2012" ;

        Replace:
          if [ GLOB $(cluster_pack_path_native)\\Include : mpi.h ]
        By:
	  if [ GLOB $(cluster_pack_path_native)\\Inc : mpi.h ]

        Replace:
          options = <include>$(cluster_pack_path)/Include 
        By:
          options = <include>$(cluster_pack_path)/Inc

   f. Run b2 --build-type=complete address-model=64 stage


4) Obtain and build the ITK library from http://www.itk.org.

Build the ITK library as follows:

   a) Download and unpack the ITK distribution to c:\rtf-supp\.

   b) Open a Visual Studio 2012 x64 command prompt and cd to the ITK
      directory, e.g. c:\rtf-supp\InsightToolkit-4.4.0\.
   
   c) Create a 'build' directory and cd into it.
   
   d) Generate build files: cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" ..
   
   d) Invoke the builds:
      msbuild /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo ITK.sln
      msbuild /p:Configuration=Release ITK.sln
      msbuild /p:Configuration=Debug ITK.sln

5) Obtain the (header-only) Eigen library from
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org.

Extract the distribution to c:\rtf-supp, such that the Eigen headers
are accessible, e.g., at c:\rtf-supp\eigen-3.1.3\Eigen\.

6) Build the RTF example applications.

Change into the base directory of the source distribution, and create
a build directory which will contain the created binaries:
 
  cd c:\rtf
  mkdir build && cd build

Set the required environment variables so as to point to the
previously compiled packages:

  set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\rtf-supp\eigen-3.1.3\
  set BOOST_ROOT=c:\rtf-supp\boost_1_54_0\
  set ITK_DIR=c:\rtf-supp\InsightToolkit-4.4.0\build\
  
Use cmake to create solution files for your platform:

  cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" ..

Invoke the release build:

  msbuild /p:Configuration=Release RTF.sln

You can then run the example applications using:

  ctest -C Release -V
